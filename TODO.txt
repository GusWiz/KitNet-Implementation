(A) Create the logic for session tracking of anomolous packets.
    - Any flagged packets should create an object that includes source ip address and count of
      anomolous packets from that address.
    - Should ideally dissappear after some amount of time with no activity (flagged packets).
        - Probably optional.
(B) Implement IPTables rule creation.
    - The logic behind this relies on task (A) from above, so (A) will have to be completed first.
    - We will have to do some testing and decide how many malicious packets should trigger a 
      firewall rule, as well as how long to block that traffic for.
        - This will include some kind of timer component in the main program loop where packets
          get flagged
(C) Update thresholding logic to probabilistically decide what the threshold rmse score is for a run
    - Currently it is done by matching the highest rmse value encountered during training
(D) Package the entire thresholding logic in realtime_stream.py into a function in another file.
    - This function should process data from the shared packet queue and return a threshold value 
      to the main thread.
(E) Implement logging as a way to replace print statements.
    - The tool to do this should be loguru. It's easy to implement and very helpful for error handling
(F) Implement a log file where program output is stored.
    - This should include the runtime messages, the anomolous packets, and any errors that occur
